# Binary Search Heuristic Algorithm

This repository contains a Python script implementing a binary search heuristic algorithm. The algorithm is designed to find a randomly selected number within a list of numbers.

## Code Explanation

The script consists of the following components:

- `selectRandomNumber`: This function selects a random number from a list after a delay of 3 seconds.
- `printDots`: This function continuously prints dots ('.') until a random number is selected.
- `findRandomNum`: This function implements the binary search-like algorithm to find the randomly selected number within the list.

The main logic of the script involves selecting a random number, and searching for the randomly selected number within the list using the binary search heuristic algorithm.
